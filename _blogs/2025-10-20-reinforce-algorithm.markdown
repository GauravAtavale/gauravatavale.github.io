The REINFORCE algorithm, introduced by Ronald Williams in 1992, is a Monte Carlo policy gradient method that has become a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning. Unlike value-based methods that learn action values, REINFORCE directly optimizes the policy by following the gradient of expected rewards.

## How REINFORCE Works

The algorithm uses the policy gradient theorem to update policy parameters in the direction that increases expected return. It collects complete episode trajectories, computes returns, and updates the policy using:

∇θJ(θ) = E[∇θ log πθ(a|s) * G_t]

where G_t is the return from time step t. This approach is elegant because it learns directly from raw rewards without requiring a value function approximation.

## Key Characteristics

**Strengths:**
- Works well with continuous action spaces
- Guaranteed convergence to local optimum
- Can learn stochastic policies naturally

**Limitations:**
- High variance in gradient estimates
- Requires complete episodes (online learning challenging)
- Sample inefficient compared to actor-critic methods

## Modern Applications

While vanilla REINFORCE has limitations, it laid the groundwork for advanced algorithms like PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) and A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic). Modern variants incorporate baselines to reduce variance and use value function approximations to improve sample efficiency.

The algorithm's simplicity makes it an excellent starting point for understanding policy gradient methods, which have powered breakthroughs in robotics, game playing, and large language model fine-tuning through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).
