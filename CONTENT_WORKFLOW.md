# Content Creation Workflow

This document outlines the complete workflow for creating and managing content on your blog.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a New Post
```bash
./scripts/new-post.sh "Your Amazing Post Title"
```

### 2. Edit Your Content
Open the generated file in your editor and add your content.

### 3. Preview Your Changes
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Visit http://localhost:4000 to see your changes.

### 4. Deploy
Push your changes to GitHub and your site will automatically update.

## Detailed Workflow

### Step 1: Content Planning
Before writing, consider:
- **Topic**: What do you want to write about?
- **Audience**: Who is this for?
- **Value**: What will readers learn or gain?
- **Categories**: How should this be tagged?

### Step 2: Create the Post
Use the automated script:
```bash
./scripts/new-post.sh "The Future of AI in 2025"
```

This creates a file like: `_posts/2025-10-21-the-future-of-ai-in-2025.markdown`

### Step 3: Write Your Content
Edit the generated file with your content. The file includes:
- **Front matter**: Metadata about your post
- **Template structure**: Organized sections to guide your writing
- **Markdown examples**: Formatting examples to follow

### Step 4: Customize Front Matter
Update the front matter at the top of your post:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2025-10-21 22:03:30 -0400
categories: [ai, technology, future]
excerpt: "Brief description that appears in blog listings"
---
```

**Key fields:**
- `title`: Your post title
- `date`: Publication date (auto-generated)
- `categories`: Tags for organization
- `excerpt`: Brief description for blog listings

### Step 5: Write Engaging Content

#### Structure Your Post
1. **Hook**: Start with an engaging introduction
2. **Main Content**: Organize into clear sections
3. **Conclusion**: Wrap up with key takeaways

#### Use Markdown Effectively
```markdown
# Main Heading
## Section Heading
### Subsection

**Bold text** for emphasis
*Italic text* for subtle emphasis
`Code snippets` for technical terms

- Bullet points
- For lists
- And organization

1. Numbered lists
2. For steps
3. Or sequences

[Link text](https://example.com)

![Alt text](image-url.jpg)
```

#### Code Examples
```python
def example_function():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

### Step 6: Preview and Test
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Check:
- [ ] Post appears on homepage
- [ ] Post page loads correctly
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] All links work

### Step 7: Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new post: Your Post Title"
git push origin main
```

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Tips
1. **Start with a hook** - Grab attention immediately
2. **Use clear headings** - Make content scannable
3. **Include examples** - Show, don't just tell
4. **End with action** - Give readers next steps
5. **Be authentic** - Write in your own voice

### SEO Best Practices
1. **Descriptive titles** - Include keywords naturally
2. **Meta descriptions** - Write compelling excerpts
3. **Internal linking** - Link to other posts
4. **External linking** - Link to relevant resources
5. **Image alt text** - Describe images for accessibility

### Categories and Tags
Use consistent categories:
- `ai` - Artificial Intelligence topics
- `technology` - General technology
- `tutorial` - How-to guides
- `thoughts` - Personal reflections
- `projects` - Project updates
- `news` - Industry news and updates

## Advanced Features

### Adding Images
1. Create an `assets/images/` directory
2. Add your images there
3. Reference them in posts: `![Alt text](/assets/images/image.jpg)`

### Code Highlighting
Use language-specific code blocks:
```python
# Python code
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

```javascript
// JavaScript code
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

### Custom Pages
Create new pages by adding `.markdown` files in the root directory:

```yaml
---
layout: page
title: "Page Title"
permalink: /page-url/
---
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Post not appearing:**
- Check the date format (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Styling issues:**
